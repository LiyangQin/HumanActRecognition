# Human Activity Recognition - Prediction Assignment Write

Human activity recognition assignment for Practical Machine Learning on Coursera

## Introduction

In this assignment we try to analyse how "well an excercise was performed using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell. In order to simulate the situaion, 6 male participants aged between 20-28 years performed weight lifting in five different fashions. 

The detail for the five are listed as below: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. 


The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.


The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
